# Traffic-Image-Segmentation
## Deep Learning project for sematic segmentation of traffic images. Part of a larger project to aid self-driving cars.


## Overview - 
In this project, I aim to build a Keras and Tenserflow based model to help segment out different objects that are present in the image. 
This project is a minor project, which forms a part of a larger project to aid self-driving cars. Its incredibly important for the AI technology running an autonomous vehicle, to be able to differentiate between various objects in the images captured by the vehicle's cameras. Before the software decides what to do with the data being collected by the vehicle, it needs to know where the objects like trees, road, other carss, buildings etc are. For this, we need to be able to perform sematic segmentation of the images.
This project aims to do just that.
